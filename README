This was my Final Project for my Database Design Class.

I had to design, build, populate, and test a database for a Catering Company. 

The Create Table statements are in IT450Final_Statements_plain and the Populated Sample Data is in IT450_ALLINSERTSTATEMENTS.

The entire project is in the PDF file named IT450FINALRYANELLORIN which includes the ERD, Relational Schema, Create Table Statements, and the SQL Queries I tested. The other PDF is the populated test data. 

The Database was created through Oracle.
