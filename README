This was my Final Project for my Database Design Class.

I had to design, build, populate, and test a database for a Catering Company. The entire project is in the PDF file named IT450FINALRYANELLORIN which includes the ERD, Relational Schema, Create Table Statements, and the SQL Queries I tested.

The other PDF is the populated test data. Each individual file is the insert statements for the test data.

The Database was created through Oracle.
